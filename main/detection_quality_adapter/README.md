# Detection Quality Adapter

Post-processing stage between a hand detector and downstream consumers.
Corrects false positives/negatives using temporal (multi-frame) logic,
without touching or retraining the detector.

See `../../planning.md` for the milestone plan and `../../hand_detection_spec.pdf`
for the source spec. Dataset lives in `../../data/` (see its README for schema).
